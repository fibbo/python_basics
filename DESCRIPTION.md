# Python Basics Course

**Instructor:** Philipp Gloor
**Institution:** University of Zurich

## Course Overview

An introductory Python programming course designed for absolute beginners. No prior programming experience required. Learn the fundamentals of programming through hands-on exercises and practical examples using Python, one of the world's most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand fundamental programming concepts applicable to any language
- Write working Python programs from scratch
- Transform problem statements into functioning code
- Know where to find resources to continue your programming journey

This course provides a solid foundation, though as we emphasize: you'll only have "started to scratch the surface" of programming—and that's exactly where every programmer begins.

## Why Python?

Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages, yet powerful enough for professional use. It features:

- **Simple, Readable Syntax** - Write `print("Hello World")` instead of the complex boilerplate required by other languages
- **Cross-Platform** - Code written on Windows runs on Mac and Linux without changes
- **Versatile** - Used in web development, data science, automation, AI, and more
- **Extensive Libraries** - Thousands of ready-to-use tools and frameworks
- **In-Demand** - One of the most sought-after skills in the tech industry

## Course Topics

### Fundamental Concepts

Start with the building blocks: variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans), operators, and how to get input from users and display output. Learn proper naming conventions and debugging techniques that will serve you throughout your programming career.

### Control Flow

Master decision-making in code with conditionals (if/else/elif statements) and learn how to combine conditions using logical operators. Build programs that can make intelligent choices based on different scenarios.

### Data Structures

Work with collections of data using lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings. Learn how to store, access, modify, and organize data efficiently—essential skills for any programming task.

### Iteration

Discover how to automate repetitive tasks using loops (while and for). Learn when to use each type and how to iterate through data structures effectively.

### Functions

Create reusable, modular code by writing your own functions. Understand parameters, return values, and scope. Learn how to break complex problems into manageable, testable pieces.

### File Operations & Persistence

Save and load data using modern Python file handling with pathlib. Work with text files and JSON to persist data beyond program execution—bringing your programs into the real world.

## Course Structure

The course includes **11 hands-on exercises** strategically placed throughout the material.
These exercises allow students to practice concepts immediately after learning them, reinforcing understanding through hands-on application.

## Teaching Philosophy

The course emphasizes:

1. **Practical Learning:** Immediate application of concepts through exercises
1. **Simplicity:** Using Python's clean syntax to focus on concepts, not syntax complexity
1. **Foundation Building:** Core concepts that transfer to other languages
1. **Realistic Expectations:** Acknowledging that this is just the beginning of the programming journey
1. **Modern Best Practices:** Using current Python features (pathlib, f-strings, context managers)


## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will have:

- Written their first Python programs
- Understood fundamental programming concepts applicable to any language
- Gained confidence in problem-solving through code
- Learned where to find help and continue their education
- Developed a foundation for further study in:
  - Data analysis and visualization
  - Web development
  - Automation and scripting
  - Scientific computing
  - Machine learning and AI

## Important Notes

- **This is a beginning:** The course explicitly states that students will have "only started to scratch the surface"
- **Practice is essential:** Programming skill develops through consistent practice
- **Debugging is normal:** Mistakes are part of the learning process
- **Resources are available:** The programming community offers extensive documentation and help
